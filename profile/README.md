# PowerShape Pro ‚Äî Windows Workflow Kit (2025)

PowerShape Pro on Windows is assembled for artists and engineers who want dependable performance, predictable color, and painless interchange between tools.

This repository curates working presets, naming rules, and end‚Äëto‚Äëend workflows specific to **PowerShape Pro** so you can move from first sketch to final frames with fewer surprises.

It focuses on Windows 10/11 tuning (drivers, caches, GPU modes) and on the IO that PowerShape Pro users actually pass to other apps (USD, FBX, STEP, EXR, and more).
